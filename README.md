# Belly Button Biodiversity


Here is an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](data/samples.json), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.


The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.


## Steps


1. Use the D3 library to read in `samples.json`.
